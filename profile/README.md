# Vision-Language @ CAMP, TUM

Welcome to the Vision-Language Group of the Chair for [Computer-Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMP)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp) of [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/cv-nassir-navab/nassir-navab/) at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/). Our team investigates the synergy between natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and deep learning, particularly in the medical field.

We focus on creating solutions that analyze and interpret medical images and articulate these findings clearly for medical professionals, thereby enhancing diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. Our research spans across areas like radiology report generation, medical visual question answering (VQA), semantic explanations, and structured reporting.
